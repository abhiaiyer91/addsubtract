# Hooks

Hooks let you run custom scripts at key points in the version control workflow.

## Overview

tsgit supports hooks similar to Git, allowing you to:
- Validate commits before they're created
- Run tests automatically
- Format code on commit
- Send notifications after actions
- Enforce team policies

## Available Hooks

| Hook | Triggered |
|------|-----------|
| `pre-commit` | Before commit is created |
| `post-commit` | After commit is created |
| `pre-merge` | Before merge starts |
| `post-merge` | After merge completes |
| `pre-push` | Before push (future) |
| `post-checkout` | After branch switch |

## Commands

### List Hooks

```bash
tsgit hooks
```

Output:
```
Installed hooks:
  ✓ pre-commit
  ✓ post-commit
  
Available templates:
  • pre-push
  • pre-merge
  • post-merge
```

### Install Hook

```bash
tsgit hooks install <hook-name>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
tsgit hooks install pre-commit
tsgit hooks install post-commit
```

### Remove Hook

```bash
tsgit hooks remove <hook-name>
```

### Run Hook Manually

```bash
tsgit hooks run <hook-name>
```

Useful for testing hooks:

```bash
tsgit hooks run pre-commit
```

## Hook Location

Hooks are stored in `.tsgit/hooks/`:

```
.tsgit/
└── hooks/
    ├── pre-commit
    └── post-commit
```

## Writing Hooks

### Basic Structure

Hooks are executable scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .tsgit/hooks/pre-commit

# Your logic here
npm run lint

# Exit 0 = success (allow operation)
# Exit non-zero = failure (block operation)
exit 0
```

### Pre-commit Hook

Block commits that don't meet criteria:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run linter
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Lint failed. Please fix errors before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Run tests
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Please fix before committing."
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

### Post-commit Hook

Actions after commit succeeds:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Send notification
curl -X POST https://slack.webhook.url \
  -d '{"text": "New commit: '"$(tsgit log -1 --oneline)"'"}'

# Update documentation
npm run docs:build
```

### Pre-merge Hook

Validate before merge:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Ensure tests pass on both branches
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests must pass before merging."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Examples

### Lint Staged Files

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-commit: Only lint staged files

STAGED_FILES=$(tsgit diff --staged --name-only | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$')

if [ -n "$STAGED_FILES" ]; then
    echo "Linting staged files..."
    npx eslint $STAGED_FILES
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        exit 1
    fi
fi

exit 0
```

### Prevent WIP Commits on Main

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-commit: Block WIP commits on main

BRANCH=$(tsgit rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
COMMIT_MSG_FILE="$1"

if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    if grep -qi "^WIP" "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "WIP commits not allowed on main branch."
        exit 1
    fi
fi

exit 0
```

### Format on Commit

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-commit: Auto-format staged files

# Get staged files
STAGED=$(tsgit diff --staged --name-only)

# Format them
echo "$STAGED" | xargs npx prettier --write

# Re-stage formatted files
echo "$STAGED" | xargs tsgit add

exit 0
```

### Commit Message Validation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# commit-msg: Validate commit message format

MSG=$(cat "$1")

# Check for conventional commit format
if ! echo "$MSG" | grep -qE "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .+"; then
    echo "Commit message must follow conventional commits format:"
    echo "  feat: add new feature"
    echo "  fix: resolve bug"
    echo "  docs: update documentation"
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

## Hook Environment

Hooks have access to:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$PWD` | Repository root |
| `$TSGIT_DIR` | `.tsgit` directory |
| `$1`, `$2`, etc. | Hook-specific arguments |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Keep hooks fast**

Long-running hooks slow down your workflow. For expensive operations:
- Run only on changed files
- Use background jobs for non-blocking tasks
- Consider CI for comprehensive checks
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Make hooks shareable**

Store hook scripts in the repository:
```
scripts/
└── hooks/
    └── pre-commit
```

Then install:
```bash
cp scripts/hooks/pre-commit .tsgit/hooks/
chmod +x .tsgit/hooks/pre-commit
```
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Handle errors gracefully**

Always provide clear error messages:
```bash
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Lint failed. Run 'npm run lint' to see errors."
    exit 1
fi
```
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hook not running">
    Ensure the hook is executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x .tsgit/hooks/pre-commit
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hook blocking commits">
    Test the hook manually:
    ```bash
    tsgit hooks run pre-commit
    ```
    Check its exit code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bypassing hooks temporarily">
    Use the `--no-verify` flag:
    ```bash
    tsgit commit -m "WIP" --no-verify
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
