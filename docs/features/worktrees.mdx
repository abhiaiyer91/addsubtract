title: Worktrees
description: "Work on multiple branches simultaneously"
---

Worktrees let you have multiple working directories for the same repository, each on a different branch.

## Overview

Instead of:
- Stashing changes
- Switching branches
- Switching back
- Restoring stash

You can:
- Create a worktree on another branch
- Work on both simultaneously
- No context switching overhead

## Commands

### Add Worktree

```bash
wit worktree add <path> <branch>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create worktree for existing branch
wit worktree add ../feature-worktree feature-branch

# Create worktree with new branch
wit worktree add ../hotfix-worktree -b hotfix-123
```

### List Worktrees

```bash
wit worktree list
```

Output:
```
/home/user/project         a1b2c3d [main]
/home/user/feature-wt      e5f6g7h [feature-branch]
/home/user/hotfix-wt       i9j0k1l [hotfix-123]
```

### Remove Worktree

```bash
wit worktree remove <path>
```

**Example:**

```bash
wit worktree remove ../feature-worktree
```

### Prune Stale Entries

```bash
wit worktree prune
```

Removes worktree entries where the directory no longer exists.

## Workflow Example

### Scenario: Working on Feature, Need to Hotfix

You're deep in feature development when a critical bug is reported.

**Without worktrees:**
```bash
wit stash
wit switch main
# fix bug...
wit commit -m "Hotfix"
wit switch feature
wit stash pop
```

**With worktrees:**
```bash
# Create a worktree for the hotfix
wit worktree add ../hotfix main

# Work on hotfix in separate directory
cd ../hotfix
# fix bug...
wit commit -m "Hotfix"
wit push

# Back to feature (no context switch!)
cd ../project
# Continue exactly where you left off

# Clean up
wit worktree remove ../hotfix
```

## Directory Structure

```
~/code/
├── my-project/              # Main worktree (main branch)
│   ├── .wit/              # The actual repository
│   ├── src/
│   └── package.json
├── my-project-feature/      # Linked worktree (feature branch)
│   ├── .wit -> link       # Links to main .wit
│   ├── src/
│   └── package.json
└── my-project-hotfix/       # Linked worktree (hotfix branch)
    ├── .wit -> link
    ├── src/
    └── package.json
```

## Use Cases

### Parallel Development

```bash
# Work on two features simultaneously
wit worktree add ../feature-a feature-a
wit worktree add ../feature-b feature-b

# Now you have three directories:
# - Main repo (can stay on main)
# - feature-a worktree
# - feature-b worktree
```

### Testing Branches

```bash
# Create worktree to test a PR
wit worktree add ../pr-123 origin/pr-123

# Test in that directory
cd ../pr-123
npm install
npm test

# Clean up
cd ../project
wit worktree remove ../pr-123
```

### Long-running Operations

```bash
# Run a long build in a worktree
wit worktree add ../build-wt main
cd ../build-wt
npm run build:production &

# Continue working in main worktree
cd ../project
# Edit files, make commits, etc.
```

### Code Review

```bash
# Review someone's branch
wit worktree add ../review origin/teammate-feature

# Open in IDE, review, then clean up
wit worktree remove ../review
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Use consistent naming**

Name worktrees clearly:
```bash
wit worktree add ../project-feature feature-x
wit worktree add ../project-hotfix hotfix-123
```
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Clean up when done**

Don't leave worktrees lying around:
```bash
wit worktree list
wit worktree remove ../old-worktree
```
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Share node_modules (optional)**

For JavaScript projects, symlink node_modules:
```bash
cd ../new-worktree
ln -s ../main-project/node_modules node_modules
```
</Tip>

## Limitations

- Each branch can only be checked out in one worktree
- The main worktree cannot be removed
- All worktrees share the same `.wit` directory

## Worktrees vs Other Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Worktrees** | No context switch, parallel work | Disk space |
| **Stashing** | No extra directories | Manual, error-prone |
| **Clone** | Complete isolation | Separate repo, sync issues |
| **Auto-stash** | Automatic | Still switches context |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Branch already checked out">
    A branch can only be in one worktree:
    ```
    fatal: 'feature' is already checked out at '/path/to/worktree'
    ```
    Remove the existing worktree or use a different branch.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Worktree directory exists">
    Remove or choose a different path:
    ```bash
    rm -rf ../old-worktree
    wit worktree add ../old-worktree branch
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Stale worktree entries">
    If you deleted a worktree directory manually:
    ```bash
    wit worktree prune
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
