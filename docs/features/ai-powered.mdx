# AI-Powered Features

tsgit includes built-in AI capabilities powered by modern LLM technology.

## Overview

AI features in tsgit help you:
- Generate meaningful commit messages
- Get intelligent code review suggestions
- Understand complex diffs
- Navigate your repository with natural language

## AI Commands

```bash
tsgit ai <command>
```

### Generate Commit Messages

```bash
# Stage your changes
tsgit add .

# Generate a commit message
tsgit ai commit
```

The AI analyzes your staged changes and suggests a descriptive commit message.

**Example:**

```bash
$ tsgit add src/auth.ts src/login.tsx
$ tsgit ai commit

Suggested message:
  "Add user authentication with login form

   - Implement auth module with JWT token handling
   - Create login form component with validation
   - Add password strength indicator"

Use this message? [Y/n]
```

### Code Review

```bash
# Review staged changes
tsgit ai review
```

Get AI-powered feedback on your changes:
- Potential bugs
- Style suggestions
- Security concerns
- Performance improvements

### Explain Changes

```bash
# Understand a diff
tsgit ai explain HEAD~3..HEAD
```

Get a plain-English explanation of what changed.

## Configuration

### Set Up API Key

AI features require an API key:

```bash
# Set your API key
export MASTRA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Or add to your shell profile:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export MASTRA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Configuration Options

```ini
# .tsgit/config
[ai]
    enabled = true
    model = gpt-4
    autoSuggest = false
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Enable AI features | `true` |
| `model` | AI model to use | `gpt-4` |
| `autoSuggest` | Auto-suggest on commit | `false` |

## AI Tools

wit's AI system includes specialized tools that give the AI agent full capabilities:

### Repository Understanding

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get-status` | Understand repository state (staged, modified, untracked files) |
| `get-diff` | Analyze changes between commits or working directory |
| `get-log` | Review commit history |
| `get-branches` | Navigate and list branches |
| `search` | Intelligent code and commit search |

### Taking Actions

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `stage-files` | Stage files for commit |
| `create-commit` | Generate and create commits |
| `switch-branch` | Switch to a different branch |
| `undo` | Undo recent operations |

### Conflict Resolution

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get-merge-conflicts` | Retrieve structured conflict information |
| `resolve-conflict` | Apply a resolution to a conflict |

The AI agent can use these tools to perform complex multi-step operations like:

```bash
# AI can understand this request and use multiple tools
wit ai "stage all test files and commit with a descriptive message"

# Or help resolve conflicts
wit ai "show me the conflicts and help me resolve them"
```

## Examples

### Smart Commit Workflow

```bash
# Make your changes...

# Let AI suggest a commit message
tsgit ai commit

# Or use the message directly
tsgit ai commit --apply
```

### Review Before Push

```bash
# Review all changes on your branch
tsgit ai review main..HEAD

# Get specific feedback
tsgit ai review --focus security
```

### Understand History

```bash
# What happened in the last week?
tsgit ai explain --since="1 week ago"

# Summarize a branch
tsgit ai summarize feature-branch
```

## Privacy & Security

<Note>
AI features send code to external APIs. Consider:
- Don't use on sensitive/proprietary code
- Review AI suggestions before applying
- Use local models for sensitive projects (coming soon)
</Note>

### What's Sent

- Diff content (staged changes)
- Commit messages (for context)
- File paths (not full file contents)

### What's NOT Sent

- Unstaged file contents
- Repository history (unless explicitly requested)
- Configuration files

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI features not working">
    Check your API key:
    ```bash
    echo $MASTRA_API_KEY
    ```
    Make sure it's set and valid.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate limiting">
    If you hit rate limits:
    - Wait a few minutes
    - Consider upgrading your API plan
    - Use local models (coming soon)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Poor suggestions">
    Help the AI with context:
    ```bash
    tsgit ai commit --context "Fixing bug #123"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Coming Soon

- Local model support (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Custom prompts
- Team-specific conventions
- Commit message templates
