Git is powerful but hostile. Cryptic errors, no real undo, and `checkout` does five different things.

**wit** is a Git-compatible CLI that fixes the UX problems while adding AI features and visual interfaces.

## What You Get

- **Full Git compatibility** - Push/pull to GitHub, GitLab, any remote
- **Real undo** - `wit undo` reverses any operation, no reflog archaeology
- **AI assistance** - Generate commit messages, review code, semantic search
- **Visual interfaces** - Built-in Web UI and Terminal UI
- **Better errors** - Suggestions for typos, clear explanations

## Quick Look

```bash
wit add .
wit commit -m "Add feature"

# Made a mistake? Actually undo it.
wit undo

# Let AI write the commit message
wit ai commit -a -x

# Visual interface
wit web
```
