# Welcome to wit

**wit** is a modern Git implementation in TypeScript that addresses many of Git's well-known usability issues while adding powerful new features like AI assistance, built-in visual interfaces, and a robust undo system.

## Why wit?

Git is powerful but has well-known issues. wit addresses them:

| Problem | Git | wit |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Security | SHA-1 (broken) | SHA-256 by default |
| Large files | Needs LFS | Built-in chunking |
| Undo mistakes | Reflog is cryptic | Simple `wit undo` |
| Branch switching | Loses uncommitted work | Auto-stash per branch |
| Merge conflicts | Inline markers | Structured JSON |
| Confusing commands | `checkout` does 5 things | Dedicated `switch`/`restore` |
| Error messages | Cryptic | Helpful with suggestions |
| Visual interface | External tools needed | Built-in TUI & Web UI |
| AI assistance | None | Commit messages, review, & more |
