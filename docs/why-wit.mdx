# Why wit?

Git is powerful. It's also hostile.

"Detached HEAD state" tells you nothing. The reflog is archaeology. `git checkout` does five different things. Every error message assumes you already know what went wrong.

We fixed this.

## The Problems

### 1. Undo is Broken

Git has undo mechanisms. They're unusable.

```bash
# What Git expects you to do:
git reflog
# decipher timestamps and commit hashes
git reset --hard HEAD@{3}
# hope you picked the right one
```

The reflog is a debugging tool, not an undo system. It's a journal of everything Git did, with no context about what *you* were trying to do.

**What wit does:**

```bash
wit undo
```

Every operation you perform is logged with intent. `wit undo` walks backwards through your actions. Made three mistakes? `wit undo --steps 3`.

### 2. Branch Switching Destroys Work

You're in the middle of something. You need to check another branch.

```bash
git checkout main
# error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten
```

Now you're stuck manually stashing, hoping you remember to pop it later, or committing half-finished work.

**What wit does:**

When you switch branches, wit automatically saves your uncommitted changes. When you come back, they're restored. No thought required.

```bash
wit switch main     # work is saved
# do stuff
wit switch feature  # work is restored
```

### 3. Commit Messages Are Busywork

You made changes. Git can see exactly what changed. But it still makes you describe it.

Most commit messages are noise: "fix bug", "update", "wip". The useful information is in the diff, not the message.

**What wit does:**

```bash
wit ai commit -a -x
```

AI reads your diff and writes the message. It sees the code. It knows what changed. It writes a better message than you would have.

### 4. Finding Code is Painful

"Where is authentication handled?" 

With Git, you grep. You read file names. You guess. You open ten files before finding the right one.

**What wit does:**

```bash
wit search "where is authentication handled?"
```

Semantic search. It understands what you're asking, not just the words. It returns relevant code, not just string matches.

### 5. Error Messages Are Cryptic

```bash
git checkout foo
# error: pathspec 'foo' did not match any file(s) known to git
```

Did you mean a branch? A file? A commit? Git won't say.

**What wit does:**

```bash
wit checkout foo
# Error: Branch 'foo' not found
#
# Did you mean:
#   - feature/foo
#   - fix/foobar
#
# Create it with: wit checkout -b foo
```

Errors explain what went wrong and suggest fixes.

### 6. The Mental Model is Wrong

Git's mental model is refs, objects, trees, blobs. That's implementation detail. Developers think in terms of branches, changes, and history.

Commands like `git checkout` conflate concepts. It switches branches. It restores files. It detaches HEAD. One command, three unrelated operations.

**What wit does:**

- `wit switch` - change branches
- `wit restore` - restore files
- `wit checkout` - still works, but we suggest the specific command

Concepts are separated. Commands do one thing.

## The AI Angle

AI isn't a gimmick here. It solves real problems:

**Commit messages**: The AI sees your diff. It writes messages that actually describe what changed. Not "update", not "fix", but "Add rate limiting to API endpoints with 100 req/min default".

**Code review**: Before you push, `wit ai review` catches obvious issues. Forgotten console.logs. Security problems. Logic errors. Your teammates' time is valuable.

**Semantic search**: Ask questions in English. Get answers with file paths and line numbers. Onboard to new codebases faster.

This isn't AI for AI's sake. These are tasks where AI genuinely helps.

## What's Ready

- Full Git compatibility (push/pull to GitHub works)
- 57 commands covering standard workflows
- AI commit messages and code review
- Semantic search over codebases
- Web UI and Terminal UI
- Self-hosted server (alpha)

## What's Not

This is early software. We ship fast. Some things are rough:

- Server features are alpha quality
- Documentation has gaps
- Some edge cases aren't handled

Check the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/wit/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for what's coming.

## Try It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/wit.git
cd wit && npm install && npm run build && npm link

wit init
wit add . && wit ai commit -a -x
```

Five minutes. See if it fits how you work.
