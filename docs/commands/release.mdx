## AI-Generated Notes

When using `--generate`, wit analyzes commits between releases and creates structured notes:

1. **Categorizes commits** by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
2. **Extracts breaking changes** from commit messages
3. **Lists contributors** who made changes
4. **Calculates statistics** (commits, files changed)

### Commit Message Parsing

For best results, use conventional commit messages:

```
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve login timeout (#123)
docs: Update API documentation
BREAKING CHANGE: Remove deprecated endpoints
```

## Examples

### Standard Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create release with AI notes
wit release create v1.2.0 --generate

# 2. Review the release
wit release view v1.2.0

# 3. Push the tag
wit push --tags
```

### Pre-release Workflow

```bash
# Create beta release
wit release create v2.0.0-beta.1 --draft --prerelease --generate

# Test the beta...

# Promote to stable
wit release create v2.0.0 --generate
```

### Generate Notes Only

```bash
# Preview notes before creating release
wit release notes v1.2.0 --style detailed

# If satisfied, create the release
wit release create v1.2.0 --generate
```

## Semver Sorting

Releases are sorted by semantic version when possible:

1. `v2.0.0`
2. `v1.2.0`
3. `v1.1.0`
4. `v1.0.0`
5. `v1.0.0-beta.2`
6. `v1.0.0-beta.1`

Non-semver tags fall back to alphabetical sorting.

## Tips

<Tip>
Use `--style changelog` to generate notes compatible with CHANGELOG.md files.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The `--previous` flag is useful when you've skipped releases or want to include changes from multiple versions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Draft and publish states are primarily managed through the web UI or API when using wit's server platform.
</Warning>
