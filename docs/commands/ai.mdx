---

The `wit ai` command provides AI-powered features for your development workflow, including natural language commands, automatic commit message generation, code review, and conflict resolution assistance.

## Overview

```bash
wit ai <command> [options]
```

## Commands

### chat / ask

Interact with the AI assistant using natural language.

```bash
wit ai "your question or command"
wit ai chat <query>
wit ai ask <query>
```

#### Examples

```bash
# Ask questions about your code
wit ai "what files have changed?"
wit ai "show me the last 5 commits"
wit ai "explain what this repository does"

# Execute commands via natural language
wit ai "create a branch for the login feature"
wit ai "stage all TypeScript files"
```

---

### commit

Generate an AI-powered commit message and optionally create the commit.

```bash
wit ai commit [options]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a, --all` | Stage all tracked files before committing |
| `--dry-run` | Preview the commit message without creating the commit |

#### Examples

```bash
# Generate message and create commit (default behavior)
wit ai commit

# Stage all files first, then commit
wit ai commit -a

# Preview the message without committing
wit ai commit --dry-run

# Stage all and preview
wit ai commit -a --dry-run
```

#### Commit Message Format

The AI generates conventional commit messages following best practices:

```
feat: Add user authentication

- Implement JWT tokens
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Add session management

Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

Supported prefixes:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `style:` - Formatting, whitespace

---

### review

Get an AI-powered code review of your changes.

```bash
wit ai review [options]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--staged` | Review only staged changes |

#### Examples

```bash
# Review all changes (staged + unstaged)
wit ai review

# Review only staged changes
wit ai review --staged
```

#### What the AI Reviews

The AI analyzes your code changes for:

1. **Potential bugs or issues** - Logic errors, edge cases
2. **Security concerns** - Injection vulnerabilities, exposed secrets
3. **Code quality** - Readability, maintainability
4. **Best practices** - Design patterns, conventions

#### Example Output

```
Code Review Results
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

src/auth.ts:42
  ⚠️  SECURITY: Password is logged in plain text
  Consider removing or masking sensitive data in logs.

src/api/handler.ts:15-20
  💡 SUGGESTION: Error handling could be more specific
  Catching all errors with a generic handler may hide issues.

src/utils/helpers.ts:8
  ✓ GOOD: Nice use of early returns for readability

Overall: 2 issues, 1 suggestion
```

---

### explain

Get an AI explanation of a commit or range of commits.

```bash
wit ai explain [ref]
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ref` | Commit reference to explain (default: HEAD) |

#### Examples

```bash
# Explain the last commit
wit ai explain

# Explain a specific commit
wit ai explain abc1234

# Explain a tagged release
wit ai explain v1.0.0

# Explain a commit from 3 commits ago
wit ai explain HEAD~3
```

#### Example Output

```
Explaining commit abc1234...

This commit adds user authentication to the application.

What it does:
  - Implements JWT-based authentication
  - Adds login and logout API endpoints
  - Creates middleware for protected routes

Why it was made:
  - Adds security to the application
  - Enables user-specific features
  - Required for the upcoming user dashboard

Files affected:
  - src/auth.ts (new)
  - src/middleware/auth.ts (new)
  - src/routes/index.ts (modified)
```

---

### resolve

Get AI assistance for resolving merge conflicts.

```bash
wit ai resolve [file]
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `file` | Specific file to resolve (optional, resolves all if omitted) |

#### Examples

```bash
# Get help resolving all conflicts
wit ai resolve

# Resolve a specific file
wit ai resolve src/config.ts
```

#### Example Output

```
Resolving: src/config.ts

Analysis:
  Our version (main):
    - Sets timeout to 30 seconds
    - Uses new API endpoint format

  Their version (feature-branch):
    - Sets timeout to 60 seconds
    - Adds retry configuration

Suggestion:
  The feature branch's longer timeout and retry logic
  complement the main branch's API changes. Recommend
  merging both changes.

RESOLVED:
```typescript
export const config = {
  timeout: 60,  // Longer timeout from feature branch
  apiEndpoint: '/api/v2',  // New format from main
  retries: 3,  // New from feature branch
  retryDelay: 1000,
};
```

---

### status

Check the AI configuration and availability.

```bash
wit ai status
```

#### Example Output

```
wit AI Status

Available: Yes
Model: openai/gpt-4o
Provider: openai

Environment Variables:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: Set
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Not set
  WIT_AI_MODEL: (not set, using default)
```

---

## Configuration

### API Keys

The AI features require an API key from a supported provider:

```bash
# OpenAI (GPT models)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Anthropic (Claude models)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Model Selection

Override the default model:

```bash
# Use a specific model
export WIT_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
export WIT_AI_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
```

---

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development with AI

```bash
# Create a feature branch
wit switch -c feature/user-auth

# Make changes...

# Review your changes before committing
wit ai review

# Generate commit message and commit
wit ai commit -a

# Explain what you did (for PR description)
wit ai explain HEAD
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Start a merge
wit merge feature-branch

# Conflict detected! Get AI help
wit ai resolve

# Review the AI's suggestions, then mark resolved
wit add .
wit merge --continue
```

### Quick Status Check

```bash
# Ask the AI about your current state
wit ai "what's my current status?"
wit ai "summarize my recent commits"
wit ai "what branches do I have?"
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review AI suggestions">
    Always review AI-generated content before committing or merging. The AI provides suggestions, not absolute answers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide context">
    More specific questions get better answers:
    ```bash
    # Less specific
    wit ai "fix bugs"

    # More specific
    wit ai "fix the null check in UserService.getById()"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use dry-run for commits">
    Preview commit messages with `--dry-run` before creating actual commits:
    ```bash
    wit ai commit --dry-run
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stage selectively">
    Stage only related changes before using `wit ai commit` for more focused commit messages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI features require an API key">
    If you see this error, set one of the supported API keys:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
    # or
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model errors">
    If you encounter model-specific errors, try a different model:
    ```bash
    export WIT_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context limits">
    For very large diffs, the AI may truncate or summarize. Consider:
    - Staging fewer files at once
    - Breaking large changes into smaller commits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
