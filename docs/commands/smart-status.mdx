# Smart Status

When you run `wit` with no arguments, you get an intelligent status display that understands what you're working on.

## Overview

Smart Status provides:

- **Context awareness** - Infers what you're working on from branch names and changes
- **Grouped changes** - Organizes files by purpose (tests, docs, API, etc.)
- **Quick actions** - Suggests next steps based on current state
- **AI integration** - Optional interactive mode to ask questions about your code

---

## Basic Usage

```bash
wit
```

This shows a concise, intelligent view of your repository:

```
  wit · my-project
  You're working on: feature: user authentication

  ● Ready to commit (3 files)
    API: auth.ts, login.ts
    Tests: auth.test.ts

  ● Modified (2 files)
    Components: LoginForm.tsx, Header.tsx

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  wit commit     · commit staged changes
  wit ai commit  · commit with AI-generated message
  wit ai "..."   · ask anything about this codebase
```

---

## Context Detection

wit infers what you're working on from:

### Branch Names

| Pattern | Detected Context |
|---------|------------------|
| `feature/user-auth` | feature: user auth |
| `fix/login-bug` | fixing: login bug |
| `refactor/api-cleanup` | refactoring: api cleanup |
| `docs/readme-update` | documentation: readme update |
| `JIRA-123/add-feature` | ticket JIRA-123: add feature |

### Changed Files

If branch name isn't descriptive, wit looks at your changes:

```
  You're working on: changes in src/api
```

or

```
  You're working on: changes across components, api, tests
```

---

## File Grouping

Changes are automatically grouped by purpose:

| Category | Files Matched |
|----------|---------------|
| **Tests** | `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, files in `test/` |
| **Documentation** | `*.md`, `README`, `docs/` |
| **Configuration** | `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, config files |
| **API** | `src/api/`, routes, endpoints |
| **Components** | `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, component files |
| **Styles** | `*.css`, `*.scss`, style files |
| **Utilities** | `utils/`, `helpers/`, `lib/` |
| **Source** | Everything else |

### Example Output

```
  ● Ready to commit (5 files)
    API: auth.ts, users.ts
    Components: LoginForm.tsx
    Tests: auth.test.ts, users.test.ts

  ● Modified (3 files)
    Configuration: package.json
    Styles: globals.css, theme.css
```

---

## Quick Actions

Based on your current state, wit suggests relevant next steps:

### When you have staged changes:

```
  wit commit     · commit staged changes
  wit ai commit  · commit with AI-generated message
```

### When you have unstaged changes:

```
  wit add .      · stage all changes
  wit wip        · quick save work-in-progress
```

### Always available:

```
  wit ai "..."   · ask anything about this codebase
```

---

## Interactive Mode

Enter interactive mode to ask questions about your codebase:

```bash
wit -i
# or
wit --interactive
```

This starts a conversation:

```
  Ask me anything about this codebase (or press Enter to exit)

  → how does authentication work?

  The authentication system uses JWT tokens stored in...
  
  → where are API routes defined?

  API routes are defined in src/api/routes/...

  →
```

Interactive mode requires an AI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

---

## Semantic Search Indexing

When you run `wit`, it automatically:

1. Checks if the repository is indexed for semantic search
2. Starts background indexing if needed
3. Re-indexes if the index is stale (>24 hours old)

You'll see:

```
  Indexing repository for semantic search...
```

This enables instant semantic code search with `wit search` and powers the AI assistant's understanding of your codebase.

---

## Not in a Repository

If you run `wit` outside a repository:

```
  wit · Git that understands your code

  Not in a repository.

  wit init        · create a new repository here
  wit clone <url> · clone an existing repository
```

---

## Customization

### Disable Background Indexing

If you don't want automatic indexing:

```bash
# No AI key = no indexing
unset OPENAI_API_KEY
wit
```

### Traditional Status

For traditional git-style status output:

```bash
wit status
# or
wit status -s  # short format
```

## Comparison with `wit status`

| Feature | `wit` (Smart Status) | `wit status` |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Context inference | Yes | No |
| File grouping | By purpose | By state |
| Quick actions | Yes | No |
| Interactive mode | Yes | No |
| Background indexing | Yes | No |
| Output style | Clean, minimal | Git-compatible |

Use `wit` for day-to-day work. Use `wit status` when you need traditional output or for scripting.
