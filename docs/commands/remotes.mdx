# Remote Operations

wit provides full support for remote Git operations, allowing you to collaborate with others using any Git hosting service including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted servers.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `wit clone <url>` | Clone a repository |
| `wit remote add <name> <url>` | Add a remote |
| `wit fetch [remote]` | Download objects from remote |
| `wit pull [remote]` | Fetch and merge |
| `wit push [remote] [branch]` | Upload changes to remote |

## Clone

Clone a repository from a remote URL:

```bash
# Clone into a new directory
wit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Clone into a specific directory
wit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-project

# Clone into current directory
wit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git .
```

### Clone Options

```bash
# Clone a specific branch
wit clone -b develop https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Shallow clone (faster, less history)
wit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

## Remotes

Manage remote repository connections:

```bash
# List all remotes
wit remote

# List remotes with URLs
wit remote -v

# Add a new remote
wit remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
wit remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Remove a remote
wit remote remove upstream

# Rename a remote
wit remote rename origin github

# Show remote details
wit remote show origin

# Update remote URL
wit remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/new-repo.git
```

## Fetch

Download objects and refs from a remote without merging:

```bash
# Fetch from origin (default remote)
wit fetch

# Fetch from a specific remote
wit fetch upstream

# Fetch all remotes
wit fetch --all

# Fetch and prune deleted remote branches
wit fetch --prune
```

After fetching, you can see what changed:

```bash
# Compare local and remote
wit log main..origin/main

# See all remote branches
wit branch -r
```

## Pull

Fetch from remote and merge into current branch:

```bash
# Pull from tracking branch
wit pull

# Pull from specific remote/branch
wit pull origin main

# Pull with rebase instead of merge
wit pull --rebase

# Pull and auto-stash local changes
wit pull --autostash
```

### Pull Conflicts

If there are conflicts during pull:

```bash
# See conflicts
wit merge --conflicts

# Resolve and continue
wit merge --continue

# Or abort
wit merge --abort
```

## Push

Upload local commits to a remote repository:

```bash
# Push current branch to tracking remote
wit push

# Push to specific remote/branch
wit push origin main

# Push and set upstream tracking
wit push -u origin main

# Push all branches
wit push --all

# Push tags
wit push --tags

# Force push (use with caution!)
wit push --force
wit push -f
```

### Push Options

```bash
# Dry run - show what would be pushed
wit push --dry-run

# Push with lease (safer force push)
wit push --force-with-lease
```

## Authentication

### GitHub Authentication

The recommended way to authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
# Login with OAuth (opens browser)
wit github login

# Check authentication status
wit github status

# Logout
wit github logout
```

### Environment Variables

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
# GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Or use GH CLI token
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Personal Access Tokens

For other Git hosts, use personal access tokens:

```bash
# Token in URL (not recommended for shared machines)
wit clone https://token@github.com/user/repo.git

# Or set in environment
export WIT_TOKEN=your-token
```

## Working with Forks

Common fork workflow:

```bash
# Clone your fork
wit clone https://github.com/you/repo.git
cd repo

# Add upstream remote
wit remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Fetch upstream changes
wit fetch upstream

# Merge upstream into your branch
wit merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
wit push origin main
```

## Tracking Branches

Set up tracking between local and remote branches:

```bash
# Push and set upstream
wit push -u origin feature

# After this, you can just use:
wit push
wit pull

# See tracking configuration
wit branch -vv
```

## Examples

### First Push to New Repository

```bash
# Initialize and commit
wit init
wit add .
wit commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote and push
wit remote add origin https://github.com/user/new-repo.git
wit push -u origin main
```

### Sync Fork with Upstream

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
wit fetch upstream

# Checkout main and merge
wit checkout main
wit merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
wit push origin main
```

### Push a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
wit switch -c feature/awesome

# Make changes and commit
wit add .
wit commit -m "Add awesome feature"

# Push feature branch
wit push -u origin feature/awesome
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

```bash
# Check if logged in
wit github status

# Re-login
wit github logout
wit github login
```

### "Updates were rejected"

Your local branch is behind the remote:

```bash
# Option 1: Pull first
wit pull
wit push

# Option 2: Force push (if you know what you're doing)
wit push --force
```

### "No upstream branch"

```bash
# Set upstream when pushing
wit push -u origin branch-name
```
