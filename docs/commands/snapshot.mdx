# wit snapshot

Create quick checkpoints of your working directory without making a full commit. Perfect for "save game" moments before risky operations.

## Overview

Snapshots capture the current state of all files in your working directory, storing them in the object database. Unlike commits, snapshots:

- Don't require staged changes
- Don't appear in history
- Can be created and restored instantly
- Are stored locally only

## Usage

```bash
# Create a snapshot
wit snapshot create [name] [description]

# List all snapshots
wit snapshot list

# Restore a snapshot
wit snapshot restore <id-or-name>

# Delete a snapshot
wit snapshot delete <id>
```

## Commands

### Create

Create a new snapshot of your working directory:

```bash
# Quick snapshot
wit snapshot create

# Named snapshot
wit snapshot create "before-refactor"

# With description
wit snapshot create "experiment" "Trying new approach to auth"
```

**Output:**
```
 Created snapshot: before-refactor
  ID: lxk4m2n7
  Files: 142
  Restore with: wit snapshot restore lxk4m2n7
```

### List

Show all available snapshots:

```bash
wit snapshot list
# or
wit snapshot ls
```

**Output:**
```
Snapshots:

before-refactor (lxk4m2n7)
  Created: 5m ago  142 files  Branch: feature/auth
  Trying new approach to auth

working-state (abc123)
  Created: 2h ago  138 files  Branch: main
```

### Restore

Restore files from a snapshot:

```bash
# By ID
wit snapshot restore lxk4m2n7

# By name
wit snapshot restore before-refactor
```

**Output:**
```
 Restored snapshot: before-refactor
  142 files restored
```

<Warning>
Restoring a snapshot overwrites files in your working directory. Make sure to commit or snapshot your current state first if needed.
</Warning>

### Delete

Remove a snapshot:

```bash
wit snapshot delete lxk4m2n7
# or
wit snapshot rm before-refactor
```

## Use Cases

### Before Risky Changes

```bash
# Save current state
wit snapshot create "safe-point"

# Try something risky
npm run dangerous-migration

# If it fails, restore
wit snapshot restore safe-point
```

### Quick Experiments

```bash
# Snapshot before experimenting
wit snapshot create "baseline"

# Try approach A
# ... make changes ...
wit snapshot create "approach-a"
wit snapshot restore baseline

# Try approach B
# ... make changes ...
wit snapshot create "approach-b"

# Compare and choose
wit snapshot restore approach-a  # or approach-b
```

### Debugging Sessions

```bash
# Snapshot at each step while debugging
wit snapshot create "step-1" "Initial state"
# ... make changes ...
wit snapshot create "step-2" "Added logging"
# ... make changes ...
wit snapshot create "step-3" "Found the bug"

# Go back to any step
wit snapshot restore step-2
```

## Snapshots vs Stash vs Commits

| Feature | Snapshot | Stash | Commit |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| Captures all files | Yes | Only changes | Only staged |
| Appears in history | No | No | Yes |
| Named | Yes | Optional | Yes (message) |
| Shareable | No | No | Yes |
| Branch context | Stored | Stored | Part of branch |
| Quick restore | Yes | Yes | Requires checkout |

## Storage

Snapshots are stored in:
- `.wit/snapshots.json` - Metadata (names, timestamps, file lists)
- `.wit/objects/` - File contents (as blobs)

Snapshots use the same content-addressable storage as commits, so identical files aren't duplicated.

## Tips

<Tip>
Use descriptive names for snapshots you plan to keep. The auto-generated ID is hard to remember.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Snapshots are recorded in the journal, so you can see your snapshot history with `wit journal`.
