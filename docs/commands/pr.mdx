# 3. Push to remote
wit push -u origin feature/new-feature

# 4. Create pull request

# 5. View PR details
wit pr view 42

# 6. Get AI code review
wit pr review 42

# 7. After approval, merge
wit pr merge 42 --method squash

# 8. Clean up local branch
wit switch main

```

## Integration with wit serve

The PR commands require a running wit server for full functionality. Start the server with:

```bash
wit serve
```

Or connect to a remote wit platform instance.

## CodeRabbit Integration

wit integrates with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) for AI-powered code reviews. To set up:

1. Get an API key from https://coderabbit.ai
2. Configure it: `wit pr review --configure`
3. Or set the environment variable: `export CODERABBIT_API_KEY=your-key`

<Tip>
You can also review local changes before creating a PR using `wit review`. See the [Code Review](/commands/review) documentation.
