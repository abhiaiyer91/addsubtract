# Lend Me Your Tokens

Like Goku's Spirit Bomb, wit is powered by collective energy. Every contribution - every token spent by contributors around the world - adds to something bigger than any of us could build alone.

**This is an open call:** We need your AI tokens to build the future of version control.

You have Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or another AI coding tool. You have tokens. We have tasks. Pick one, copy the prompt, and let's build wit together.

---

## How It Works

1. **Clone wit** and set up your environment
2. **Pick a task** from the list below
3. **Copy the prompt** into your AI coding tool
4. **Submit a PR** with your AI-generated contribution

Every contribution counts. Every token helps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/wit.git
cd wit
npm install
npm run build
npm link
wit --version
```

## Priority Tasks

The highest-impact items we need help with right now.

### Fix Integration Test Failures

The test suite has failing integration tests that need to be fixed.

```
Run `npm test` and fix all failing tests. Focus on the integration tests in 
`tests/integration/`. For each failing test:

1. Understand what the test is trying to verify
2. Determine if the test is wrong or the implementation is wrong
3. Fix the issue and ensure the test passes
4. Run the full test suite to make sure you didn't break anything else

Start with `npm test` and work through failures one by one.
```

### Command Reference Documentation

Every wit command needs documentation in the `docs/commands/` directory.

```
Create comprehensive documentation for wit commands. For each command:

1. Look at the implementation in `src/commands/`
2. Document all flags and options
3. Add practical examples
4. Show expected output

Start by listing all commands in `src/commands/` and cross-reference with 
existing docs in `docs/commands/`. Create missing documentation files.
Use the existing docs as a template for format and style.
```

### ESM/CommonJS Configuration Cleanup

The build configuration works but is fragile and needs cleanup.

```
Audit and fix the ESM/CommonJS configuration in this project:

1. Review `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and any build scripts
2. Identify inconsistencies in module resolution
3. Ensure the build works cleanly with `npm run build`
4. Test that `npm link` works correctly after building
5. Document any necessary changes

The goal is a clean, consistent module configuration.
```

### Error Message Audit

Every user-facing error should be helpful with actionable suggestions.

```
Audit all error messages in the codebase for helpfulness:

1. Search for `throw new` and `console.error` across `src/`
2. For each error, ask: "Does this tell the user what went wrong AND how to fix it?"
3. Add suggestions using the TsgitError pattern from `src/core/errors.ts`
4. Prioritize errors users hit frequently (commit, push, merge conflicts)

Example of a good error:
throw new TsgitError(
  'Branch not found: feature',
  ErrorCode.REF_NOT_FOUND,
  ['Did you mean: feature-branch?', 'Run wit branch to see all branches']
);
```

---

## Documentation Tasks

### Installation One-Liner

```
Create a one-liner installation script for wit:

1. Create an install script that works on macOS and Linux
2. Should download the latest release and add to PATH
3. Consider using curl | bash pattern or npm global install
4. Test on a fresh system
5. Update the quickstart docs with the new install method

Look at how other CLI tools (like rustup, nvm, bun) do this.
```

### "5 Minutes to Wow" Tutorial

```
Create a "5 minutes to wow" tutorial for wit in `docs/quickstart.mdx`:

1. Start with installation
2. Show `wit init` and basic workflow
3. Highlight the "wit" zero-command that shows smart status
4. Demonstrate `wit ai commit` for AI-generated messages
5. Show `wit search` for semantic code search
6. End with something impressive that Git can't do

The goal: new user goes from install to "wow, this is better" in 5 minutes.
```

### Demo Video Script

```
Create a demo video script for wit in a new file `docs/demo-script.md`:

1. 30-60 second intro: what is wit and why it matters
2. Show the zero command (`wit`) and smart status
3. Demonstrate AI commit message generation
4. Show semantic search ("where do we handle auth?")
5. Quick look at the web UI
6. Call to action: how to get started

Include exact terminal commands and expected output.
```

2. Fix any formatting differences
3. Add missing options: --stat, --name-only, --name-status, --cached
4. Ensure color output matches Git conventions
5. Add compatibility tests

Use `src/core/diff.ts` and `src/commands/diff.ts`.
```

### Add Missing Command Options

```
Add missing options to wit commands:

1. Pick a command from `src/commands/`

1. Review existing tools to understand the pattern
2. Add useful new tools:
   - `explainCode` - explain what a piece of code does
