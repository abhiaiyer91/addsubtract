# Getting Started

This guide gets you from nothing to using wit. No fluff.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.13.0 or higher
- npm

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/wit.git
cd wit
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

Now `wit` is available globally.

## Initialize a Repository

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
wit init
```

Done. You have a wit repository.

## Basic Workflow

This is Git. If you know Git, you know this.

```bash
# Stage files
wit add .
wit add src/

# Commit
wit commit -m "Add feature"

# Check what's happening
wit status
wit log
wit diff
```

### Stage and Commit Together

```bash
wit commit -a -m "Fix bug"
```

The `-a` flag stages all tracked files before committing.

### Quick WIP Save

Don't want to write a message? Don't.

```bash
wit wip -a
```

Creates a commit with an auto-generated message like `WIP: 3 files changed`.

## Branches

```bash
# Create and switch
wit switch -c feature

# Switch back
wit switch main

# List branches
wit branch

# Delete
wit branch -d feature
```

<Note>
When you switch branches, wit automatically saves your uncommitted work and restores it when you come back. No more "you have uncommitted changes" errors.
</Note>

## Undo Mistakes

This is why wit exists.

```bash
# Undo the last thing you did
wit undo

# Undo the last 3 things
wit undo --steps 3

# Undo a commit but keep the changes staged
wit uncommit
```

Every operation is logged. `wit undo` walks that log backwards.

## Visual Interfaces

### Web UI

```bash
wit web
```

Opens `http://localhost:3847` with:
- Visual commit graph
- Side-by-side diffs
- One-click staging
- Search across commits and files

### Terminal UI

```bash
wit ui
```

Full-screen terminal interface. Navigate with arrow keys, stage with `a`, commit with `c`.

### ASCII Graph

```bash
wit graph
```

```
● a1b2c3d (main) Latest commit - Alice, today
● e5f6g7h Add feature - Bob, yesterday
● i9j0k1l Initial commit - Alice, last week
```

## Working with GitHub

wit is fully compatible with GitHub.

### Login

```bash
wit github login
```

Opens a browser. Authenticates via OAuth. Stores credentials securely.

### Clone

```bash
wit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Push and Pull

```bash
wit push origin main
wit pull
```

Same as Git. Works with GitHub, GitLab, any Git remote.

## AI Features (Optional)

This is the other reason wit exists. Requires an API key.

### Setup

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
# OR
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key

# Verify setup
wit ai status
```

### AI Commit Messages

Stop writing commit messages. Let the AI read your diff.

```bash
# Stage changes, then:
wit ai commit

# Or all in one:
wit ai commit -a -x
```

The `-x` flag executes the commit. Without it, you review first.

### AI Code Review

```bash
wit ai review
```

Reviews your staged changes. Catches obvious issues before your teammates do.

### Semantic Search

Ask questions about your codebase in plain English.

```bash
wit search "where is authentication handled?"
wit search "how does the diff algorithm work?"
```

This uses embeddings to find relevant code, not just text matching.

## Self-Hosted Platform (Optional)

wit includes a self-hosted Git server with PRs and issues.

### Start the Server

```bash
# Needs PostgreSQL
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/wit
wit serve --port 3000 --repos ./repositories
```

### Push to Your Server

```bash
wit remote add origin http://localhost:3000/myuser/myproject.git
wit push -u origin main
```

### Create PRs and Issues

```bash
wit pr create -t "Add feature" -b "Description here"
wit issue create "Bug: login fails"
```

This is optional. wit works fine as a standalone CLI.
