# Quickstart

## Install

Requires Node.js 22.13.0+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/wit.git
cd wit
npm install && npm run build && npm link
```

Verify it works:

```bash
wit --help
```

## Your First Repository

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
wit init
```

## Basic Workflow

```bash
# Stage and commit
wit add .
wit commit -m "Initial commit"

# Check status
wit status
wit log
```

## Branches

```bash
wit switch -c feature    # create and switch
wit switch main          # switch back
wit branch -d feature    # delete
```

Uncommitted changes are automatically saved when switching and restored when you return.

## Undo Mistakes

```bash
wit undo              # undo last operation
wit undo --steps 3    # undo last 3 operations
wit uncommit          # undo commit, keep changes staged
```

## AI Features (Optional)

Set an API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key
```

Then:

```bash
wit ai commit -a -x    # AI writes commit message
wit ai review          # AI reviews staged changes
wit search "where is auth handled?"
```

## Visual Interfaces

```bash
wit web    # browser UI at localhost:3847
wit ui     # terminal UI
wit graph  # ASCII commit graph
```

## Working with GitHub

```bash
wit clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
wit push origin main
wit pull
```

Full GitHub compatibility. Works with any Git remote.
