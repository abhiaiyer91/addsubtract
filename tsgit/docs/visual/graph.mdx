# ASCII Graph

View your commit history as a visual graph directly in the terminal.

## Usage

```bash
tsgit graph
```

## Output

```
● a1b2c3d4 (HEAD -> main) Latest commit - Alice, today
● e5f6g7h8 Add user authentication - Bob, yesterday
│
│ ● f9g0h1i2 (feature-branch) Feature work - Charlie, 2 days ago
│ ● j3k4l5m6 More feature work - Charlie, 3 days ago
├─┘
● n7o8p9q0 Merge pull request #42 - Alice, 1 week ago
├─╮
│ ● r1s2t3u4 Fix critical bug - Bob, 1 week ago
├─╯
● v5w6x7y8 Initial commit - Alice, 2 weeks ago
```

## Understanding the Graph

### Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `●` | Commit |
| `│` | Branch line |
| `├─╮` | Merge (two parents) |
| `├─╯` | Branch rejoins |
| `├─┘` | Branch divergence |

### Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `HEAD -> main` | Current branch |
| `(main)` | Branch name |
| `(tag: v1.0)` | Tag |
| `(origin/main)` | Remote branch |

## Options

```bash
# Show all branches
tsgit graph --all

# Limit number of commits
tsgit graph -n 10
```

## Example Scenarios

### Linear History

```
● Latest commit
● Previous commit
● Earlier commit
● Initial commit
```

### Feature Branch

```
● (main) Latest on main
│
│ ● (feature) Feature commit 2
│ ● Feature commit 1
├─┘
● Base commit
```

### Merge Commit

```
● Merge feature into main
├─╮
│ ● Feature work
│ ● More feature work
├─╯
● Earlier main work
```

### Multiple Branches

```
● (main) Latest
│
│ ● (feature-a) Work on A
├─┤
│ │ ● (feature-b) Work on B
├─┼─╯
│ ●
├─╯
● Base
```

## When to Use

The graph command is perfect for:

- **Quick overview:** See branch structure at a glance
- **Before merging:** Understand what will be merged
- **After merging:** Verify merge was successful
- **Debugging:** Find where branches diverged
- **Scripting:** Output is parseable

## Comparison

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Quick glance at history | `tsgit graph` |
| Detailed commit info | `tsgit log` |
| Interactive exploration | `tsgit web` |
| Full-featured terminal | `tsgit ui` |

## Tips

<Tip>
Combine with grep for quick searches:
```bash
tsgit graph | grep "feature"
```
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `-n` to limit output for large repositories:
```bash
tsgit graph -n 20
```
</Tip>
