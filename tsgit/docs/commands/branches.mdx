# Branch Commands

tsgit provides intuitive branch management with automatic stashing when switching branches.

## branch

List, create, or delete branches.

```bash
tsgit branch [name] [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-d <name>` | Delete a branch |
| `-D <name>` | Force delete a branch |
| `-m <old> <new>` | Rename a branch |
| `-a` | List all branches (including remote) |

### Examples

```bash
# List all branches
tsgit branch

# Create a new branch
tsgit branch feature-login

# Delete a branch
tsgit branch -d feature-login

# Force delete (unmerged branch)
tsgit branch -D experimental

# Rename a branch
tsgit branch -m old-name new-name
```

### Example Output

```
  develop
  feature-auth
* main
  staging
```

The `*` indicates the current branch.

## switch

Switch to a different branch.

```bash
tsgit switch <branch> [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c <name>` | Create a new branch and switch to it |
| `-` | Switch to the previous branch |

### Examples

```bash
# Switch to existing branch
tsgit switch develop

# Create and switch
tsgit switch -c feature-new

# Go back to previous branch
tsgit switch -
```

<Note>
When you switch branches, tsgit automatically saves your uncommitted changes and restores them when you switch back. No more losing work!
</Note>

## checkout

Git-compatible alias for switching branches and restoring files.

```bash
tsgit checkout <branch>
tsgit checkout -b <new-branch>
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-b <name>` | Create a new branch and switch to it |

### Examples

```bash
# Switch to a branch
tsgit checkout main

# Create and switch
tsgit checkout -b feature-new
```

<Tip>
We recommend using `tsgit switch` for branches and `tsgit restore` for files, as they make intent clearer. `checkout` is provided for Git compatibility.

## Auto-Stash Feature

One of tsgit's best features is automatic stashing when switching branches.

### How It Works

1. When you switch branches with uncommitted changes:
   - tsgit saves your changes to a branch-specific stash
   - You switch to the new branch with a clean state

2. When you switch back:
   - tsgit automatically restores your saved changes
   - You can continue exactly where you left off

### Example

```bash
# You're on main with uncommitted changes
tsgit status
# Shows: modified src/feature.ts

# Switch to fix a bug (changes are auto-saved)
tsgit switch hotfix-branch

# Work on the hotfix...
tsgit commit -a -m "Fix critical bug"

# Switch back (changes are auto-restored)
tsgit switch main

tsgit status
# Shows: modified src/feature.ts (your changes are back!)
```

### Configuration

Auto-stash is enabled by default. You can control it in `.tsgit/config`:

```ini
[tsgit]
    autoStashOnSwitch = true
```

## Branch Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start from main
tsgit switch main

# 2. Create a feature branch
tsgit switch -c feature-user-auth

# 3. Work on your feature...
tsgit add .
tsgit commit -m "Add login form"

# 4. Need to fix something on main?
tsgit switch main  # Auto-saves any uncommitted work

# 5. Fix and commit on main
tsgit commit -a -m "Fix typo"

# 6. Go back to feature
tsgit switch feature-user-auth  # Auto-restores your work

# 7. Continue working on feature...
```
