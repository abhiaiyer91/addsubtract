# Merge Commands

tsgit provides an improved merge experience with structured conflict resolution.

## merge

Merge a branch into the current branch.

```bash
tsgit merge <branch> [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-commit` | Perform merge but don't create a commit |
| `--abort` | Abort the current merge |
| `--continue` | Continue merge after resolving conflicts |
| `--conflicts` | Show current conflicts |
| `--resolve <file>` | Mark a file as resolved |

### Examples

```bash
# Merge a branch
tsgit merge feature-branch

# Merge without auto-commit
tsgit merge feature-branch --no-commit
```

---

## Merge Workflow

### Simple Merge (No Conflicts)

```bash
# Ensure you're on the target branch
tsgit switch main

# Merge the feature branch
tsgit merge feature-login
```

Output:
```
Merging feature-login into main...
Merge successful!
```

### Merge with Conflicts

When conflicts occur:

```bash
tsgit merge feature-branch
```

Output:
```
Merging feature-branch into main...
CONFLICT: src/index.ts
CONFLICT: src/config.ts

Automatic merge failed. Fix conflicts and run:
  tsgit merge --continue
```

---

## Conflict Resolution

### View Conflicts

```bash
tsgit merge --conflicts
```

Output:
```
Conflicting files:
  1. src/index.ts (3 conflicts)
  2. src/config.ts (1 conflict)
```

### Structured Conflict Format

Unlike Git's inline markers, tsgit uses structured JSON for conflicts:

```json
{
  "file": "src/index.ts",
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "line": 15,
      "ours": "const timeout = 5000;",
      "theirs": "const timeout = 10000;",
      "base": "const timeout = 3000;"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resolving Conflicts

1. **Edit the file** to fix conflicts
2. **Mark as resolved:**
   ```bash
   tsgit merge --resolve src/index.ts
   ```
3. **Complete the merge:**
   ```bash
   tsgit merge --continue
   ```

### Abort a Merge

If you want to cancel the merge:

```bash
tsgit merge --abort
```

---

## Visual Conflict Resolution

For complex conflicts, use the visual interface:

```bash
tsgit web
```

The web UI provides:
- Side-by-side diff view
- Click to choose "ours" or "theirs"
- Manual editing for custom resolution
- Preview of merged result

---

## Merge Example

Here's a complete merge workflow:

```bash
# 1. Start on main branch
tsgit switch main

# 2. Attempt merge
tsgit merge feature-auth

# 3. If conflicts occur, view them
tsgit merge --conflicts

# 4. Open and edit conflicting files
# (or use tsgit web for visual resolution)

# 5. Mark files as resolved
tsgit merge --resolve src/auth.ts
tsgit merge --resolve src/config.ts

# 6. Complete the merge
tsgit merge --continue

# 7. Verify the merge
tsgit log --oneline -n 5
```

---

## Undo a Merge

Made a mistake? Just undo it:

```bash
tsgit undo
```

This works whether the merge:
- Completed successfully
- Is still in progress
- Has conflicts

---

## Merge Strategies

tsgit currently supports recursive merge strategy (similar to Git's default). Additional strategies are planned for future releases.

## Tips

<Tip>
Before merging, ensure your branch is up to date:
```bash
tsgit switch feature-branch
tsgit status  # Check for uncommitted changes
tsgit switch main
tsgit merge feature-branch
```
</Tip>

<Warning>
Don't use `--force` unless you really mean it. The undo command is your friend if something goes wrong.
</Warning>
